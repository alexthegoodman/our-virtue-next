# 像一位国王

在神的国度里，国王不是统治者

他们将自己置于人民之下

在神的国度里，国王像仆人

他们追求人民的利益

<br />

确实，国王将面临许多逆境

但国王拥有奉献的力量

他们不放弃，克服许多威胁

所以支持那些谦卑自己的人

寻求行善和帮助他人

因为这些人将用心引导人民

<br />

要时刻警惕罪恶的领袖

因为他们是罪恶和邪恶的奴隶

他们不是神或人民的奴隶

<p></p>

- "But Jesus called them unto Him and said, “Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you; but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your slave (servant, not literal), even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life as a ransom for many.”" - Matthew 20:25-28
- “Jesus answered them, “Very truly, I tell you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. The slave does not have a permanent place in the household; the son has a place there forever. So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed” - John 8:34-36
- “But it shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all.” - Mark 10:43-44
