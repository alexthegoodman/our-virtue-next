# 感恩

曾经有一个时刻

一个女人来到耶稣面前

她为他做了一件美好的事

将香膏倒在他的头上

<br />

感激与感恩

源自内心深处

冷漠则显示出无知

大地的稀缺与健康的珍贵

怎能被忽视？

<p></p>

<br />

确实，耶稣对他的祝福心怀感激

在众人面前尊重她的礼物

义人也将心存感恩

因为我们的父在暗中注视

<br />

- ““Leave her alone,” said Jesus. “Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial. *Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her*.”” - Mark 14:6-9
- “And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”” - Luke 22:19
