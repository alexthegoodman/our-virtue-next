# Peace with Less

Poverty is the bane of life

The body may be weak

And it may be overcome by disease

The mind consumed by evil

Haunted by horror

Full of worry

Indeed, poverty strikes every part

What do the homeless have for themselves?

What does a lost soul have for itself?

Yet in life there is still hope

No matter how much loss comes

Your Heavenly Father is still near

His Love can shine through thick clouds

Raging winds cannot cover His whispers

And no food or tool is more valuable than He

So have peace with less

Let your loss come, do not cry

Thank your Father from your heart

Certainly, He knows of the truth
