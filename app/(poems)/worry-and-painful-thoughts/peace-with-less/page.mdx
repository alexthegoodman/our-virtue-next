# Peace with Less

Poverty is the bane of life

The body may be weak

And it may be overcome by disease

<br />

The mind consumed by evil

Haunted by horror

Full of worry

<br />

Indeed, poverty strikes every part

What do the homeless have for themselves?

What does a lost soul have for itself?

<br />

Yet in life there is still hope

No matter how much loss comes

Your Heavenly Father is still near

<br />

His Love can shine through thick clouds

Raging winds cannot cover His whispers

And no food or tool is more valuable than He

<br />

So have peace with less

Let your loss come, do not cry

Thank your Father from your heart

Certainly, He knows of the truth
