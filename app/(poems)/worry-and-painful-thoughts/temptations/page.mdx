# Temptations

Satan is the driver of sin

He seeks after its welfare

And he nurtures its development

<p></p>

<br />

Among us are many temptations

Within us are only more temptations

So be aware and pray to God

Ask Him to spare you of temptations

Ask Him to redirect you from evil

That is how you will see with light

So you will not be blinded and confused

<p></p>
