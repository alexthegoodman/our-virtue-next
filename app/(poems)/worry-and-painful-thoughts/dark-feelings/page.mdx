# Dark Feelings

Anger has snared countless people

Indeed, the angry often feel justified

Yet one should be far from their anger

For it will never serve anybody

Yet Satanâ€™s joys are often deceiving

When people have a love for wealth,

When they celebrate the loss of an enemy,

Or when they dwell on the unfairness of life,

And are overcome with envy

Truly, all of these things are abhorrent to God

He is concerned only with goodness and truth
