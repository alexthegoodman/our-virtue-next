# Peaceful Thoughts

Painful thoughts are often in conflict

Painful thoughts are a waste and a burden

They cycle all day long

They haunt you for a long time

<br />

Why change the unchangeable

Why control the uncontrollable

<br />

Good thoughts are accepting

Good thoughts are hopeful

<br />

Those people with peaceful minds

Place their thoughts on Heaven above

They think of God and good things

Sparing everyone they meet

<br />

<br />

Do not be consumed by worry

Donâ€™t let coming dangers frighten you

Pessimism is grounded in delusion

<p></p>

<br />

And do not be sluggish and immobile

Be prepared and consider the science

Treating urgently what is urgent

And taking action for the helpless
