# Being Hated

Carrying the burdens of God is hard

Even without those who seek your harm

<br />

Serving God closely brings on hate

You will find yourself with enemies

They will scoff at you and belittle you

They will delegitimize you and set traps for you

<br />

Those who hate you may seek your harm

They will exceed the bounds you expected

But do not turn towards hate or anger

Even when they are constant in their attacks

<br />

When they are harsh and unrelenting

Pray to God, seek His strength, and persevere

Our Creator never forgets his faithful servants

Have faith, and He will not leave you behind

<br />
