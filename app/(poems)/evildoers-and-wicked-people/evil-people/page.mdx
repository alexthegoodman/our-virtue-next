# Evil People

Evil people are hard to understand

They act unpredictably

They commit horrible atrocities

<br />

Many of them are filled with demons

Completely insane, under their own torture

Yet even within the most heinous

There is light

<br />

Indeed, God cares for not only the righteous

Rather, he cares for all the living

Even the wicked

<br />

---

<br />

Let not those who save lives

Credit their passion to their pain

Remember those who destroy lives

Truly, they credit their pain as well
