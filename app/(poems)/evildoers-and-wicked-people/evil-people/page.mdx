# Evil People

Evil people are hard to understand

They act unpredictably

They commit horrible atrocities

Many of them are filled with demons

Completely insane, under their own torture

Yet even within the most heinous

There is light

Indeed, God cares for not only the righteous

Rather, he cares for all the living

Even the wicked

---

Let not those who save lives

Credit their passion to their pain

Remember those who destroy lives

Truly, they credit their pain as well
