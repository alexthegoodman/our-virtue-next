# The Slave Owner

The demons are sadistic liars

Their father is the inventor of sin

<br />

Torturers share both hands with Satan

Possessors of people share their bed with him

<br />

Whoever steals peopleâ€™s free will

That one has done the most heinous

And created a tragedy worse than death

<p></p>

<br />

Such people are in severe danger of Hell

They may never escape the rulers of their new home

Where the authorities take endless joy in their suffering

<p></p>

<br />

Yet the helpless will be given amazing honor

Infinite abundance and overflowing love from all over

And the Presence of the Almighty will heal their souls

<p></p>

<br />

Only the slave owners who turn away from their sin

Who receive justice and the due penalty on Earth

May have comfort on the day of reckoning

<p></p>
