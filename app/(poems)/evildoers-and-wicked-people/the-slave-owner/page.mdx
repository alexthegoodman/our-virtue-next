# The Slave Owner

The demons are sadistic liars

Their father is the inventor of sin

Torturers share both hands with Satan

Possessors of people share their bed with him

Whoever steals peopleâ€™s free will

That one has done the most heinous

And created a tragedy worse than death

Such people are in severe danger of Hell

They may never escape the rulers of their new home

Where the authorities take endless joy in their suffering

Yet the helpless will be given amazing honor

Infinite abundance and overflowing love from all over

And the Presence of the Almighty will heal their souls

Only the slave owners who turn away from their sin

Who receive justice and the due penalty on Earth

May have comfort on the day of reckoning
