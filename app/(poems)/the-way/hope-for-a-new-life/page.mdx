# Hope for a New Life

Life is full of suffering and none is spared

The Earth barely sustains its people

For man needs not grain, but the Love of God

Yet hope remains for those in despair

For the Love of God fuels an endless energy

Capable of sustaining countless lives

So have high hopes for a Heavenly Paradise

Our Father loves us enough for home

Do not give Hell too much attention

Knowing God is not full of animosity
