# Go His Way

Our God created the Heavens and the Earth

He determined what is good and called it His own

While Satan did everything else and it was all evil

<br />

Wisdom and righteousness are to be sought after

Folly and wickedness are Satan's joys and they are sin

<br />

God's Children are on the side of the light

Their enemies are completely wayward

<br />

The pain of trials strengthen a person

But woe unto the one who delivers trials

For the relief of gifts rescue a lost one

And it is the generous who are destined for peace
