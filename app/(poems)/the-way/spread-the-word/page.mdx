Never leave the lost behind

For darkness is waiting to overtake them

<br />

Your Father loves the little birds

He even gives life to the ants and bees

Consider how much He loves those lost

Truly, He would give away all His possessions

To fill their hearts with faith

<br />

Our Father blesses the one who saves others

The one who searches and does not stop

Has the Love of God in his heart

<br />

Our hearts ache over those lost and alone

Their souls are worth more than perfection

<br />

So be not above anyone

Do not fight with the unbelievers

Rather, be understanding, and accept them!

Befriend them!

<br />

Yes, Your Father asks that you share the Gospel

Yet in these poems there is power,

Power to echo Jesus and strengthen the people!

So pass these poems along to your children

Bringing God’s glory to fill your house
