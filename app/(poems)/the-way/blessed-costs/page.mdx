# Blessed Costs

If you really cared for the poor, you would work for their sake

If you really cared for the poor, you would take on their hardships

If you really cared for the poor, you would be friends with them

Our Father blesses the one who blesses others

He equips him and builds him up and gives him strength

Our Father raises up His Children and separates the bad from the good

He causes one to lose part of himself so that he might grow

Doing good is for the long-term investor

For in all good things, there is both a cost and a reward

Take up the burden of others, take up the mission of God

For in all great blessings, one shall incur the cost of his blessing

So when you turn your cheek, you shall incur the sting

And when you go the extra mile, you shall incur the expense

When you care for the sick, your wealth shall decrease

Take up the burden of others, take up the mission of God
