# Seek Not Earth

People seek after life from the Earth

The lifeless Earth beneath their feet

<br />

The perfume is for only a short time

But your love should never decay

The fire lasts only a few hours

But God's Love shall never fade

<br />

Our Father watches always

Not a thought escapes His Sight

His Majesty is met with you

Though billions roam the Earth

<br />

He cares for each morning

And if you shall manifest His Ways

Your mornings shall be lovely indeed

<br />
