# Mind the Times

Rituals bring a people closer together

As habits they build solidarity

Exalted falsely as a means of salvation

They carry burdens and relieve them also

When something is done regularly for God

It only matters when done with heart

One who is genuine towards God pleases Him

But one who obeys reluctantly should pray

The repentant wash before prayer

But the water does not save

The modest cover their heads

But the clothing does not save

Your Creator does not require these rituals

He desires the virtues in their hearts

So let your faith nurture itself within you

Ask Your Father to lead you unto the honorable

---

Indeed, if you are blessed with knowledge

You will be mindful of the times

Honor the people who rest routinely

Every Sunday on the Sabbath Day

The people do not work for the sake of God

Unless someone is in need of help

And honor those who watch the Moon

In Ramadan is one month of fasting

Except in the early mornings

And in the late evenings

Our Father has set out His vision

In the Age to Come with peace on Earth

All the people will obey the One True God

And believe in the one Messiah, Jesus Christ

Worship and Love your Creator!

He gives Strength to the Weak!
