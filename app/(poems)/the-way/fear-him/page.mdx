# Fear Him

Yet remain on your guard

Make sure you are self-aware

For Our God is always watching

And He is always the winner

<br />

Be ready, the rich people

And the evil ones alike

There is a penalty prepared

And it is truly unbearable

<br />

Unlike the Heavenly Afterlife of Paradise

It is full of pain and anguish

<br />

So repent for your sins

Forgive and give your money

Otherwise you may leave Earth

Only to meet a blazing fire

<br />
