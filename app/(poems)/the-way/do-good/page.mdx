# Do Good

Imagine what people have done to succeed

Think of the lengths they traverse to attain wealth

People have strained themselves for Earthly treasures

Knowing these treasures disappear when death comes

<br />

But the jewels which are eternal never disappear

And doing good deeds is possible even for the poorest

So traverse those same lengths to attain goodness

And you will find yourself rich in Heaven

<br />

Shall you seek out good word?

Or do you seek out the words of an orator

Shall you put your thoughts on goodness?

Or do you think only of what is advantageous

Shall you put work into good deeds?

Or do you focus solely on your goals

Seek out what is good, and have faith in God's cause

Then He will grant you all that is needed

<br />
