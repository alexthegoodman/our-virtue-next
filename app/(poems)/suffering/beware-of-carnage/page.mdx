# Beware of Carnage

O, Father, help the stranded one

Help those taken by calamity

Hurricanes lay homes to ruin

The wildfire leaves ash behind

<br />

Indeed, the chronic pains are weighty

Just as the horrors and their traumas

Like the winds and rains raged inside

Causing all sorts of inner loss

<br />

The victim is left to rebuild

Given only examples of evil

Numb to all sorts of hurtful things

<p></p>

<br />

The loving will understand

A victim's unrighteous ways

Form no godly basis for judgement

<p></p>
