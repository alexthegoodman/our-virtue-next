# Endure Affliction

God's Children do like the Angels

Greater in heart and in mind, full of love

Attacks and traps do not distract them

They be kind, they wish blessings in return

Long sentences doom not His faithful

They will pray for patience and strength

Though they will become numb to their pain

Without declining, but bearing good fruit

Be not in despair at all

Darkness doesn't teach

But its victims do learn

Take heed of simple corrections

And do good amidst tribulations

Even taking on pain all day and night

Speak not empty words, but God's Word

Your trial will test you in some way

So always return to His Will

God will send you relief

He will give it where you do not expect it
