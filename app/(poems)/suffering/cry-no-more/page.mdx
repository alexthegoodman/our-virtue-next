# Cry No More

Darkness always comes in time

We all grieve in time, for the Earth is no home

<br />

Our past haunts us even today

Hardships last far past their hope

Is the Earth just crumbling rock?

Is there no sense in what happens to us?

<br />

Nay, God Directs All Things!

All The Sand and All The Snow!

<br />

Might I fail in an endeavor

God prepares me for another

Might I lose my shelter

God keeps for me a blanket

Might I never find true love

God shows His Love instead

<br />

<br />

Missing what you have lost

Remembering what you never had

<br />

Trials call for more than you have

What you have calls for more love

There is no strength or desire

<br />

Your Father calls you away

Away from the whole world

Indeed, it is a futile place

Few escape Earth's suffering

<br />

Your Creator calls you to Him

Where trials lose their power

And what you've had pales in comparison

Unlike eternal life and His Love

<br />

For your God is a caring Creator

He is filled with sorrow at your suffering

So give to others and call upon Him

He is always near and complete in knowledge
