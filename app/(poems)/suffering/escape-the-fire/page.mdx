# Escape the Fire

The fire will boil your inner self

Its caretakers will blame you

What a woeful home it is

<p></p>

<br />

Might you learn despite this?

Might you have reverence for your Creator

So your love could overflow,

Even seeing the light in your captors?

<br />

The fire will take everything

You will cry out and be abandoned

Like a prisoner or slave

<p></p>

<br />

But can't God save you even now?

With faith, might you pray to Him,

And with heart, forgive again and again?

<p></p>

<br />

Yes, He Determines All Things!

Always, God is The Most Capable!

<br />

Those dark times will trap you

Escape is an invisible door for you

Dark times bring us to survive

And survival is not progress

<br />

Indeed, dark times beget dark times

Its victim must search for a way

Yet it will remain covered and out of reach

Until one changes and does what God wills

<br />

God guides him to act righteously

Knowing his life does not beget righteousness

<br />

Let him give unto others heavenly times

Let God be pleased and reward him plenty

<br />

Seek not to send people into hard times

You seek a benefit

But incur the cost and its penalties

<p></p>

<br />

Rather, be of the most helpful

Pull a person out of his suffering now

And teach him his way out afterwards

<p></p>
