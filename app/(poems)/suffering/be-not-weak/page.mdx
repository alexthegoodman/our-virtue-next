# Be Not Weak

Our Father is the poor's advocate

He helps the helpless

Without Him, tyrants would rage on

The unheard would have no voice

<br />

When the quake is great

And the devastation moreso

Strongmen are broke to pieces

And thoughts long forgotten

Will return to nurture evils

<br />

Without strength, who can overcome?

Full of pride, who can please God?

<br />

Indeed, He is near the weak and loves them

Yet through prayer He will strengthen you

<br />

God Overcomes All,

God Bestows All Strength!
