# Be Not Weak

Our Father is the poor's advocate

He helps the helpless

Without Him, tyrants would rage on

The unheard would have no voice

When the quake is great

And the devastation moreso

Strongmen are broke to pieces

And thoughts long forgotten

Will return to nurture evils

Without strength, who can overcome?

Full of pride, who can please God?

Indeed, He is near the weak and loves them

Yet through prayer He will strengthen you

God Overcomes All,

God Bestows All Strength!
