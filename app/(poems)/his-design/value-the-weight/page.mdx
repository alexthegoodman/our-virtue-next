# Value the Weight

Life is full of fleeting distractions

The Earth itself makes promises it cannot keep

The surface reveals little of what is within

While the petty things demand much

Remember that which feeds the soul

Truly it is the Word of God

Surely it is love and the next life

So do not let the attractive things persuade you

Neither dishonor people for small wrongs

But appreciate the weighty matters

And celebrate that which is worthy
