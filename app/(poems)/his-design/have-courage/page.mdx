# Have Courage

By His guiding words,

Our Creator shaped the Earth

And by His Supreme Commands

He determines what He wishes

<br />

Why fear losing along the way?

Knowing your Father is with you

<br />

Be not afraid of anyone

Not even of yourself

Few are capable of very much

Except that it be stopped

<br />

Have courage and be brave

Your Father will answer your call

And His knowledge is complete

Glory and destruction in His design

Are both only 7 precise steps away

<br />

Amazing God, Who Heals People!

Righteous Creator, Who Sends Rain!

<br />
