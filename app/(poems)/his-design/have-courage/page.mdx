# Have Courage

By His guiding words,

Our Creator shaped the Earth

And by His Supreme Commands

He determines what He wishes

Why fear losing along the way?

Knowing your Father is with you

Be not afraid of anyone

Not even of yourself

Few are capable of very much

Except that it be stopped

Have courage and be brave

Your Father will answer your call

And His knowledge is complete

Glory and destruction in His design

Are both only 7 precise steps away

Amazing God, Who Heals People!

Righteous Creator, Who Sends Rain!
