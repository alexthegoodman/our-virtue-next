# Like a King

In God’s Kingdom, the Kings are not rulers

They place themselves beneath their people

In God’s Kingdom, the Kings are like servants

They seek after the benefit of their people

Indeed, Kings will face many adversities

But Kings have the strength of devotion

They do not give up and survive many threats

So support those who humble themselves

Seeking to do good and be helpful

For those ones will guide the people with heart

Remain on your guard against sinful leaders

For they are slaves to sin and evil

They are not slaves of God or of people

- “Jesus answered them, “Very truly, I tell you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. The slave does not have a permanent place in the household; the son has a place there forever. So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed” - John 8:34-36
- “But it shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all.” - Mark 10:43-44
