# Penalty and Mercy

How can a penalty be enjoyable?

Could a man of God find them pleasing?

Surely, he would consider them rare and unhappy

Godâ€™s Children value mercy above all law

They use mercy to provide for the people

And they give it as an offering to God

Pray that you receive foresight

For penalties can break and fester evils

And adding them wrongly may be inhumane

Do not add them without warning

Do not add them to some over others

Be fair and true in your dealings

Knowing that the measure would be due you

If you had done what they had done

For you are of knowledge enough

Disorder is not worth a lack of punishment
