# Penalty and Mercy

How can a penalty be enjoyable?

Could a man of God find them pleasing?

Surely, he would consider them rare and unhappy

<br />

God’s Children value mercy above all law

They use mercy to provide for the people

And they give it as an offering to God

<br />

Pray that you receive foresight

For penalties can break and fester evils

And adding them wrongly may be inhumane

<br />

Do not add them without warning

Do not add them to some over others

<br />

Be fair and true in your dealings

Knowing that the measure would be due you

If you had done what they had done

<br />

For you are of knowledge enough

Disorder is not worth a lack of punishment
