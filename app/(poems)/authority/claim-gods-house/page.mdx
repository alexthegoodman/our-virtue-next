# Claim God's House

The owner of the house

Carries the blame and its burdens

But a homeowner should be reliable

<br />

Leaders are disgusted by neglect

They care for their people dearly

And ensure their protection

<br />

Let them fill their house with light

Calling their Creator to be the Head

Declaring their house God's House

A house abiding by God's Commandments
