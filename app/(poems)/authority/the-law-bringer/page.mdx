# The Law-Bringer

Authorities set the laws and rules

They direct people to uphold them

Their subjects approve of their governance

For they lack the means to uphold any law

Yet assign authority only to the trustworthy

For they cause grief and sin when they work

Knowing that a people cannot defend themselves

But that a measure is certainly due (the criminals)

Remember, God is Highest in His Kingdom!

Look, even the animals are subordinate to Him!
