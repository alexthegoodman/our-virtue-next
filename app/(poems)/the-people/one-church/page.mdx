# One Church

As believers we gather together

Together we praise and worship our God in love

We share teaching and help each other grow in the Word

And we dedicate time to giving back to the poor

<br />

Yet out of Churches may come difficulty and pressure

Some invest in themselves more than they give back

And others involve themselves in government matters

Why bring Caesar into a place of worship?

<br />

Let your mind be your first Church

Ask God to make it into a worthy dwelling

You needn't appear before Church people

No requirement has been made of you
