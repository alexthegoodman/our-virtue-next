# His Servants

Prophets have blessed knowledge upon us

They have given their lives for Godâ€™s cause

They are beholden only to Our Lord, the One True God

<br />

They taught us of wisdom and events to come

Among them are many, known and unknown

Surely, they all labor hard for the Lord

<br />

Yet they are only given knowledge by angels

None of them are like Our Savior, Jesus Christ

<br />

Indeed, it was He who taught us the ways of Our Father

It was He who washed away the sins of many

And He who healed the disabled, the possessed, and even the dead
