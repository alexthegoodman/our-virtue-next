# One Book

Among the greatest books of all time

You will find the Psalms of David

Perched next to it are the Proverbs of Solomon

Calling all who seek God and wisdom

Yet only the Gospel is timeless

The others are from angels or mere men

People may learn from many prophets

But only Jesus delivers the true Word of God

Bring the Parables of Jesus close to you

Plant them securely and do away with wordplay

For the light in His teaching is brighter than all the stars

And His love is greater than the breadth of the universe
