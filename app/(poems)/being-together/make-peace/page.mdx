# Make Peace

> Don't fight within or against yourself
> Don't fight with your neighbors
> Don't fight with your opponents
> Don't fight with your family
> Don't fight with your friends
> Don't fight with arms
> Don't fight with words
> Don't even fight with the dart of an eye or a smile

Jesus taught us to return hate with love

Indeed, he blessed the peacemakers

For they are the Children of God

<p></p>

<br />

Peaceful ways are found by the selfless

They are on the side of the truth

Those who quarrel and lead wars should be cast away

And to the peaceful be granted all authority

<br />

They settle matters and seek compromise

By God's guidance, they seek diplomacy

Revenge is far from them, unprofitable and in ruin

<p></p>

<br />

They surrender to their enemies

And provide understanding for their wishes

They put their distaste to the side

By tolerating that which they detest

<br />

They sow little disgruntlement

By avoiding provocative words

And allow contrary opinions

So that they may have peace with their own

<br />

Even evil, violent attacks

It disturbs them not

For they nurture peace ahead of themselves

<p></p>
