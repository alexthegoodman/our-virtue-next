# Be Understanding

Your brothers and sisters are weak like you

They go astray from time to time

<br />

The understanding do not shun others

They would not tell others how to feel

The understanding would not judge by their own deeds

They would not expect others to act like themselves

<br />

God's Children show understanding

Consider your background and past

Think of your hardships and weaknesses

We are gentle and thoughtful of each other

<br />

- “If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.” - John 15:18-19
