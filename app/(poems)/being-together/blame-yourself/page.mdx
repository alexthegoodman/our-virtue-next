# Blame Yourself

The selfless seek not their own lives

They do not work to fill their own accounts

<br />

The wise see the error in their ways

But fools believe they did nothing wrong

<br />

Be humble enough to blame yourself when fights arise

While others may focus on what they did right

<br />

Have courage and do not be afraid

The truth will vindicate those it chooses

The self-serving will avoid liability

Until a full accounting has been made known
