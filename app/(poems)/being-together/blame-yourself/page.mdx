# Blame Yourself

The selfless seek not their own lives

They do not work to fill their own accounts

The wise see the error in their ways

But fools believe they did nothing wrong

Be humble enough to blame yourself when fights arise

While others may focus on what they did right

Have courage and do not be afraid

The truth will vindicate those it chooses

The self-serving will avoid liability

Until a full accounting has been made known
