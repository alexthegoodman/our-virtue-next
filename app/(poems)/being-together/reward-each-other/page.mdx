# Reward Each Other

God, Our Father has sent the Gospel

He has called those in conflict to peace

And it is not the prosecution of your opposers

That He desires you place your hopes on

Rather, place your thoughts on the next life

And foresee the reward of His Children

Acknowledge a person's progress

Give to them for their righteousness

Surely, when Jesus comes again

He will reward everyone for their deeds

When one has only done what is expected

Give them relief from their burdens

When one has proven himself trustworthy

Provide him with privilege, and others likewise

Discipline is not the first choice of the wise

A reward is always considered by the mindful
