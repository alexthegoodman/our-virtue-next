# Follow The Doctor

People have dirty hair and bodies

They have disease and sicknesses

Even some hidden away within their hearts

Put on them by what happened before

Others will turn away and become shy

Those made similar to them have become estranged

For the Earth and its ways have overtaken them

Yet there is One who has overcome the World

Our Master and Teacher, the Chosen One of God

It was Jesus who was called Doctor and Healer

He would touch the sick with open palms

With unwashed hands He would eat food

And He would spend His time with sinners

Jesus would teach of Heavenly things few understood

He spoke in parables which were too amazing to comprehend

Yet it was not the righteous but the sick who He spoke to

Do as Jesus commands and follow His Word with intention

That is the way to God’s wishes and pleasures
