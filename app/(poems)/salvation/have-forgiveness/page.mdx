# Have Forgiveness

Our Creator sees what we are unaware of

He forgives and shows us mercy every day

Yet He does not forgive the unforgiving people

So Jesus taught us to forgive with strength

<br />

Pay close attention to yourself

Resentment has been the captor of many

Revenge and penalty a common pit

<br />

Forgiveness is from the heart

It speaks not a word against anyone

It seeks out the best of memories

<br />

Even when the pains are great

God desires that you forgive

Even when you're too weak to keep forgiving

God wants you to pray for strength

<br />

Yes, it is your constancy in forgiveness

Which brings Our Father to approval

Indeed, Our God loves to forgive those who forgive

He will not hold those forgiven to account

<br />
