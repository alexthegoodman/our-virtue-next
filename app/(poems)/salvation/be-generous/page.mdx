# Be Generous

What is life at all,

If you have nothing to remember?

Why should a child have no where to turn,

Crying out, “Father, help! God, save me!”

<br />

Words cannot describe the pain

Even images cannot depict the horror

For suffering is a private experience

<p></p>

<br />

Let those with food eat it

So that they may not be tired

Make them not lazy or over restful,

Give them empathy for hardship

<br />

There is pain in the work

There are struggles and costs

But be grateful amidst your pain

And deliver relief to the others

<br />

Give your life by devoting it to giving back

Lay it down by your work

And build God’s Kingdom on Earth

Taking part in the Salvation of Jesus

<br />

---

<br />

Come to God with wisdom

Approach Him humbly

<br />

He does not lead all people

The one who gets excited by money

Or the one full of dreams and fantasies

About riches or fame or Earthly success

<br />

He shows love and uplifts His Chosen

Who heed guidance selflessly

Who dream of giving back

And expect nothing in return

<br />

Our Father will strengthen them,

He will help and deliver them!

People and angels have honored many gifts

Some a fraction, some a tenth, others a third

Some say to give what’s left beyond needs

<p></p>

<br />

Yet God does not ask any of these of you

Almighty God, in all His Power, calls you out

He asks that you give all you have to the poor

Do it all at once, and then follow Jesus

<br />

Yes, be generous whenever you can

But don’t be deceived by wealth and life

Be not afraid at all

For not only will you survive your gift

Even more, you shall truly find your own life

<p></p>

<br />

Even when you doubt, Jesus shall catch you

Truly, the one who gives all will see the Power of God

<br />

But what of the single parents,

What about the children?

What of those whose hearts are not ready?

Certainly, Your Father will always accept your gift

<br />

Yet begin work for His sake, and when you do,

Do not turn back

<br />

Praise God!

He doesn’t want to place His sheep in danger

So do not let the old ways of travel be your means of travel

For some there was a donkey, for others a camel

For us there is both the vehicle and the internet

<p></p>

<br />

Give your provision, your resources

Give your time, your knowledge

<br />

Be a knowledgeable servant

Hide away from the public eye

Let your giving be in secret

So God may reward you in Paradise

And your gift may be between you and Him

<br />
