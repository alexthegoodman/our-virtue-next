# Love One Another

Jesus spoke God’s Word

And he gave commands from God

Yet only few commands were given

To love your God is the greatest commandment

One without wisdom can live by it

Our God exalts love above all knowledge

Indeed, love your Creator ahead of all things

Truly He is your Father and looks after you

What can be more important than Him?

He’s the Good One who is always there for you

And love those who cross your path

Have compassion for their hardship

Overlook their wrongs and help them

For love is the most pleasing to your Father

---

Indeed, love is the most powerful force

It can drive people across the whole earth

And love can heal a person’s inner self

So manifest love in its many forms

And you will be greater than a monk or priest

---

Treat your opposers like friends

Remind them their Creator loves them also

Indeed, Our God is greater than wars and grudges

His Love is not hampered by our mutual grievances

---

Relieve the load for another

And take on suffering as love

Labor for their health

Give them your time

And what you value

This example Jesus set for us

By giving his life so we could have ours

---

Pray for love in all your words

Pray for love in all that you do

Speak pleasantly unto others

Speak the truth

Be not two-faced

Choose gentle words

Search out the light in people

Find the good in what they do

Be empathetic out of your love

Give thought to others feelings

Consider their perspectives

Show you feel what they feel

---

Love may consist of doing good deeds

Yet the deepest love is unconditional

Those with God’s Love in their hearts,

Give love without it being earned

Be not partial to anyone

Give love to the unloved

Give attention to the forgotten

Forgive the pariah
