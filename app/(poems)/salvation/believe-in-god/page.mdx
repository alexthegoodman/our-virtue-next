# Believe in God

Our God is greater than all things,

He exalts the humble and the small,

He brings the poor up from down low,

and brings the lost into the light

<br />

His Will is greater than that of people

He has knowledge of all secrets and truths

Our God is a good God, for He shows both mercy and love

He is also generous, whether that be in this life or the next

<br />

Indeed, He saves the one who calls out to Him

He has power to turn the evil toward the light

For Our God is a good God, and many are saved in death

<br />

He has created the Next Life, the Earth, and all things Unseen,

He has made some things enjoyable, even miracles

Yet His Presence is the Ultimate Reward, our greatest hope

<br />

<br />

May He grant godspeed to the one who is patient,

May He grant glory to the one who seeks God's

May He grant riches to the one who seeks goodness,

May He grant peace to the peaceful

May He grant happiness to the one who seeks others,

Praise God in all His Might, nothing dictates against Him
