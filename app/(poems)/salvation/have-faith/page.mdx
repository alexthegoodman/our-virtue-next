# Have Faith

Who can describe faith with words?

Can any language describe it?

<br />

Faith cannot be trapped in a bottle

Faith cannot be seen with the naked eye

Only by what it touches and leaves behind

Might you possibly spot its presence

<br />

<br />

When faith is present in a person

Can anybody put a stop to them?

Nay, except for momentary illusions

<p></p>

<br />

With faith, what is not possible for a person?

One can heal in unexplainable ways

One can move the unmovable objects

Indeed, with faith all things are possible

<br />

<br />

Faith is found in the good decisions of people

Faith itself is an undoubtful belief in God

And knowing that He will do what you believe

<p></p>

<br />

The one who stands firm to the very end

That is the one who Our Father notices

Definitely, He will not leave that one unfulfilled

<p></p>

<br />

<br />

Feelings and numbness

Knowledge and ignorance

What can they do to faith?

Do they have any power?

<br />

Perhaps it is the fire or the storm

Which desires to overcome faith

Can even death overcome faith?

<p></p>
