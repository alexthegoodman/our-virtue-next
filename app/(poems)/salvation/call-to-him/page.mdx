The People are blessed with power

Power to speak inwardly and to be heard

Our God listens to what is not spoken aloud

And He knows when you acknowledge Him in your heart

It is a power called prayer, it is one of His great joys

Prayer should be honest and true

He desires not that you hide from Him

Be genuine about your hardships

Praying earnestly about your hopes and wishes

Be loving, giving Him your praise and thanks

Do not pray with many words

One can speak to Him in a moment

Another may spend a while in stillness

He listens to your heart, He knows what is unsaid

There are many different ways to pray

But it is the genuine who Our Father always accepts

Pray not for riches

Pray not for selfish gain

Our Father loves prayers to gain virtue

He answers prayers which help others

The one who makes a prayer for the right things

Only needs a dash of faith for it all to come true

One who calls out to the Creator longs for Him secretly

He hears their cry and shows them mercy

Yet it is the loving time obeying His Gospel,

And the regular prayer which grows your relationship

Our Father loves our dedicated time alone with Him

Whether once, three, or five times a day

Give Him time in prayer, in worship, or in study

Indeed, it is not too much, it is due Him
