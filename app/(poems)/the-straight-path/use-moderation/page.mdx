# Use Moderation

Extremes are traps for the unwise

Counter-productive and unreasonable

Yet so attractive to the unaided eye

It's better to leave nothing overdone or underdone

Be both mindful and moderate

And seek what is most appropriate

Our Father delights in those who care for each other

So do not seek after anything dangerous

And surely, extremes are dangerous
