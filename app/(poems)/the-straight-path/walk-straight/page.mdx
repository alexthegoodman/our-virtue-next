# Walk Straight

Hypocrites expect from others correct behavior

But they do not practice it themselves

They condemn others for evil deeds

But run when they are condemned likewise

They provide special allowances for some

While others worthy of those privileges are denied

The hypocrites say, "Condemn him"

But they lack foresight, and thereby condemn themselves

Those who are straight in their hearts and minds

They have no inner conflict

And they repent for their failings

Those who please God will tolerate what they dislike

And they will practice what they believe in

Our God protects His loyal believers

He lets nothing fall except what He allows

He holds up the straight and honest

He shelters them from calamity

And heals their inner diseases

- “How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.” - Matthew 7:4-5
