# Respect Your Family

Our Father looks after His Children

Those who love Him, He raises up

<br />

He watches on, complete in knowledge

So be born of self-control, be full of love

<br />

How tragic it is when two people

Meant to be brothers enjoined by spirit

Are split not by righteousness, but by sin

<p></p>

<br />

Of the offensive moves, there is violence

Driven by justifications, one directs with his hands

Strikes and blows, not signals or signs

Often deluded by fear, anger, envy, misled, and mistaught

<br />

Some seek dark satisfactions, the devil's win

By the help of a weapon or device

That is a loved one given to temptation

<p></p>

<br />

Your Father guides you as He pleases

You may flee, you may scream

Show your love for others if you stay

Endure the affliction, speak God's Word

<br />

Make not a threat to another

Take no threat as a joke

Respond not with testing, make no challenges

Show respect, and be of the humble

<br />

To each person belongs their own body

Direct your own body, direct your own house

<br />

<br />

Honor your Father with your emotions

Anger is the gate of the ignorant

Love is on the other side for the faithful

<p></p>

<br />

So be not angry with each other

Each of His Children has great value

Indeed, your mind is like a star

Your soul cannot be exchanged for diamonds

<br />

Our Father created each of us as the spectrum

One blue, one green, one red

Be fruitful and spread seed region to region

Associate with other peoples

Befriend those not of your own kind

<p></p>

<br />

An authority may uphold their Law

And parents may add discipline

But brothers and sisters seek not power over each other

They reward each other often

They seek after each others benefit

<p></p>
