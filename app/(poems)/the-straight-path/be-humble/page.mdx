# Be Humble

Recall when Our Savior humbled himself

And showed his love and heart of forgiveness

By washing his disciple’s feet by hand

<br />

Who can turn away from all wealth,

And who can turn away from all power,

So that he could show his love to his people?

<br />

That is the love of Jesus Christ

That is the value of a humble heart

<br />

So take not the high spot in your affairs

Rather, take the low spot without fear

For this reflects your heart to God

<br />

And do not walk about in an overbearing way

Do not be pretentious or egotistical

But let yourself appear as less than others

<br />

The humble cannot possibly stand before God

For they consider themselves unworthy and incapable

Yet God is completely capable and always wins

<br />
