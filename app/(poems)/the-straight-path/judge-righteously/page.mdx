# Judge Righteously

Judgement is not befitting of people

Only Our Creator has complete knowledge

None can discern or comprehend likewise

Our Father gives the same choice to all

Both the humble and the prideful

That they should judge or not

Indeed, Our Creator judges the one who judges

Surely, like your dealings He shall deal with you

And by His judgement He gives out mercy

The person who judges by the surface

An impression, a sound, or sight

Our Creator shall be just as harsh in return

Rather, be of correct judgement

And do not exercise it often

---

All of us as brothers and sisters

Expect events to come to pass

For others to treat us in a certain way

And for one thing to mean another

These are merely expectations

Which may not be correct at all

Until a conclusion must be drawn

And a final judgement called

Be not surprised at these times

When expectations are proven wrong

Indeed, judgement is tempting by way of surety
