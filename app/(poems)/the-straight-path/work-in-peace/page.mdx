# Work in Peace

Life is full of work

For by your contribution

You shall earn a due reward

Thereby feeding yourself and your children

So seek wisdom in all your work

Do not neglect your contribution

Do not fall for deceitful shortcuts

Work with prudence, avoiding haste

Work with much patience

Years may pass before you are finished

Be a worthy partner and friend

Respect those you work with

Even assure your continued strength

Take time to relax and rejuvenate

Knowing that laziness leads to poverty

And poverty does not help the poor
