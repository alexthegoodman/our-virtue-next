# Practice The Word

The Word is for the believers

His People put His Word into practice

They stress not in adhering to His teaching

For they are not proud but forgive and are forgiven by Him

<br />

Our Father teaches both wisdom and goodness

And He nurtures one towards them over time

The Word is for those now wayward

For by a single prayer or a moment of silence

One can step back onto God's righteous path

No person is too far from following Him again

<br />
