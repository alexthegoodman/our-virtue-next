# Act Honorably

Our God delights in those who seek wisdom

He supports those who desire to be honorable

For Our God is on the side of the righteous

<p></p>

<br />

Set an example for others that is safe

If they act like you, they should find goodness

So do what is honorable and repeatable

<p></p>

<br />

Seek out what is good of those who succeed

Be aware of the wisdom in their deeds

Persevering in what is loving and forgiving

<p></p>

<br />

Let your honor be a part of your character

Have integrity and do what is right in private

Understanding that good deeds are not for a show

<p></p>

<br />

Much will tempt you towards sin and evil

Saying, “Believe me, this is for your benefit”

Yet evil deeds carry no more weight for success

Than the good deeds which are born of love
