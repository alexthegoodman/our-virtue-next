# Control Yourself

God allows for us difficulty on Earth

Anger problems inhibit innocent people

Sexual desires pull people into darkness

Poverty tests people every single day

<br />

Yet Our Father is compassionate

He sees one in distress

The one overcoming it

Doing right and showing love

And He rewards those extra efforts

<p></p>

<br />

So pray Him to nurture self-control

Ask Him to gain self-discipline

<br />

Despite the pressures of life

Be of the moderate and calm

Under no authority at all

Deprive yourself to do what you must

<br />

Every upsetting instance

Evokes a gentle and calm response

One who is slow to anger

Nurtures toleration and patience
