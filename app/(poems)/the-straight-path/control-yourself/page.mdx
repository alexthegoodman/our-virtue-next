# Control Yourself

God allows for us difficulty on Earth

Anger problems inhibit innocent people

Sexual desires pull people into darkness

Poverty tests people every single day

Yet Our Father is compassionate

He sees one in distress

The one overcoming it

Doing right and showing love

And He rewards those extra efforts

So pray Him to nurture self-control

Ask Him to gain self-discipline

Despite the pressures of life

Be of the moderate and calm

Under no authority at all

Deprive yourself to do what you must

Every upsetting instance

Evokes a gentle and calm response

One who is slow to anger

Nurtures toleration and patience
