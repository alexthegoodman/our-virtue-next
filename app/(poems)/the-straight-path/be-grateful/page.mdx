# Be Grateful

There was a time when

A certain woman came to Jesus

She did a beautiful thing to him

By pouring perfume on his head

<br />

Appreciation and gratefulness

They come from the heart

Indifference shows a lack of understanding

The scarcity of Earth, and the value of health

How can they be disregarded?

<p></p>

<br />

Indeed, Jesus was grateful for his blessing

Honoring her gift in front of all the others

The righteous will be grateful as well

As Our Father watches in secret

<br />

- ““Leave her alone,” said Jesus. “Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial. *Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her*.”” - Mark 14:6-9
- “And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”” - Luke 22:19
