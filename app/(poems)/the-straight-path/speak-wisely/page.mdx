# Speak Wisely

Be mindful of your speech

Words may lead people to peaceful destinations

And they have power to destroy decades of work

Remember what the wisest speakers do

They hold their tongue and think carefully

They show prudence and speak less

Heed the guidance of Jesus Christ

Listen to the Gospel’s sayings on words of light

As for the petty sins

Do not condemn them

For you are more alike

With a humble heart and foresight

As for the deeds of others

Do not criticize them

Aim for higher ways, lighter ways

Ask questions, make suggestions

Deception is perverse speech

Lies mislead the decision makers

They trample on love and relations

They create distrust between people

Making excuses for offenses

Leads one blindly into hateful speech

Wise people take them lightly

They are also mindful of people's feelings

Give in to no pressuring speech

It is a friend of force, it is a foe to respect
