# Don't Love Poison

How easy it is to honor an excellent person

But the mirror is full of disapproval

Might you despise yourself for your life?

Yet your Creator loves your soul more than body

<br />

The body finds itself in decay

Strength is given way, time is poured

A food unlike the fruits, a poisonous berry

Patiently, you eat, slowly, it also eats

<br />

Oneself is low but also high

Indulging in the seductive taste

Coming back to drink and to buy

Gaining now, and losing later

<br />

Returning again and again

To give your health, to pay the premium

This is addiction, one of Satan's dreams

What is worth little shall cost you much
