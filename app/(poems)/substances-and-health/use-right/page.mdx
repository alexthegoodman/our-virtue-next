# Use Right

Our Father is not pleased by drunkenness

He does not like outbursts or aggression

Nor does He love sleeping all the time

One should walk and talk carefully

Avoiding heavy drugs and overuse

Such drugs are intended for doctors

Others lose strength, but keep victims

One should choose what to take with patience,

And should remain in control of themselves
