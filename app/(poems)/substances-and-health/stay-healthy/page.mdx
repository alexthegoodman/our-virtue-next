# Stay Healthy

Our Creator is the greatest scientist

He has knowledge of the smallest things

So be mindful of what is around you

Also be mindful of your own body

<br />

Indeed, be watchful over your whole health

And eat what is safe and nourishing

Wouldnâ€™t it be heartbreaking not to care for yourself

And to find your body wasting away

Awaiting a slow death, slow to appear?

<p></p>

<br />

But science drives machines

And machines in turn provide your harvest

So be conscious of science

Humbly accepting the truth as it is
